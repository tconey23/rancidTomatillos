## Context:
<!-- wins, challenges, time spent, etc -->
- Group project by programmers in their 3rd month of learning coding.
- Took approximately 30 hours to complete test suite and functionality
- Goals:
  
  - Implement React Fundamentals to create logical and streamlined data flow
  - Implement React Router to allow multiple pages
  - Create easily navigable and appealing user interface
  - Utilize Cypress for end-to-end testing of comprehensive user stories
  - Retrieve and POST data with network requests as needed for UI display
  - Design an accessible website
    
- Wins:

  - Adapting Router mid-project to refactor a working project to a better working project
  - Gaining confidence with Cypress to thoroughly test user flow
  - Dynamic search for filtering movies
  - Implementation of a modal with conditional rendering in Router
  - Integrating fetch requests into app with specific calls for different element events
  
- Challenges:

  - Introduction of three new technologies and full app refactoring midway through project
  - Responsive design, accounting for different screen types with a grid layout
  - Gaining comfortability with Cypress syntax 
  - Error handling with Router and intercepts in Cypress

## Future Improvements:

  - Second round of responsiveness adaptation
  - Further breakdown of functionality for more seemless developer navigation
